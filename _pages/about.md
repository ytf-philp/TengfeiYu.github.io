I am a third-year master's student at Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, with a research focus on SFT, LLM applications, speech-to-text, and machine translation technologies.

During my master's studies, I have had the privilege of being mentored by Assistant Professor [Xuebo Liu](https://sunbowliu.github.io/) and Professor [Min Zhang](https://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/MinZhang). Prior to my current studies, I served as a research intern at JD Explore Academy (2021-2022), under the guidance of Dr. [Liang Ding](https://liamding.cc/).

In my leisure time, I enjoy engaging in fitness activities, traveling, singing, and sleeping.
