I am a third-year master's student from Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen). My research interests include SFT and applications of LLM, as well as speech-to-text and machine translation.

During my master's studies, I have been fortunate to be advised by Assistant Professor [Xuebo Liu](https://sunbowliu.github.io/) and Professor [Min Zhang](https://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/MinZhang). Before that, I worked as a research intern at JD Explore Academy (2021-2022), under the supervision of Dr. [Liang Ding](https://liamding.cc/).

In my free time, I enjoy fitness, traveling, singing, and sleeping.
