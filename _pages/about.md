I am a third-year master's student from Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen). My research interests include SFT and applications of LLM, as well as speech-to-text and machine translation.

During my master's studies, I have been fortunate to be advised by Assistant Professor Xuebo Liu and Professor Min Zhang. Before that, I worked as a research intern at JD Explore Academy (2021-2022), under the supervision of Dr. Liang Ding.

In my free time, I enjoy fitness, traveling, singing, and sleeping.
